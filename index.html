        <h3>
            Goals & Objectives of Organization
        </h3>
        <p>
            Answer any questions about airplanes and rockets club members may have that canâ€™t be easily googled. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Allow people to gain a better understanding of aerospace industry in general - What requirements do aircraft have in commercial vs defense applications.
            <br>
            <br>
            Allow people to understand how aircraft & spacecraft work - designing and manufacturing aircraft is a complicated process, Aerospace club will look at the supply chain for the different components
            <br>
            <br>
            Learn about real world applications of physics(Aerodynamics, forces) and chemistry(Manufacturing aircraft and propulsion).
        </p>
